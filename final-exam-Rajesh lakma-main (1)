Access the assignment repository from the provided GitHub Classroom link.
Clone the repository to your local machine and review the existing codebase to understand its structure and functionality.
2. Create a New Component
Component Creation: Add a new component to the existing project. If the project is built using React, for example, you would create a new .js or .jsx file for the component.
Example: If youâ€™re working with React, create a new file named NewComponent.js in the src/components directory.
jsx
Copy code
// src/components/NewComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const NewComponent = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>This is the New Component</h2>
        </div>
    );
};

export default NewComponent;
3. Include the New Component in the Current Tab
Update Tab Component: Modify the existing tab component to include the new component. This typically involves importing the new component and including it in the render method or JSX return statement.
Example: If there is a tab component named CurrentTab.js, update it as follows:
jsx
Copy code
// src/components/CurrentTab.js
import React from 'react';
import NewComponent from './NewComponent';

const CurrentTab = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Current Tab</h1>
            <NewComponent />
        </div>
    );
};

export default CurrentTab;
4. Create a New Tab
New Tab Component: Create a new tab that will hold the components from the old tab. Create a new file for this tab component.
Example: Create a new file named NewTab.js:
jsx
Copy code
// src/components/NewTab.js
import React from 'react';
import OldComponent from './OldComponent'; // Replace with actual components

const NewTab = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>New Tab</h1>
            <OldComponent /> {/* Include all relevant old components here */}
        </div>
    );
};

export default NewTab;
5. Update Routing or Navigation (if applicable)
Modify Navigation: Update the routing or navigation component to include the new tab. Ensure that users can navigate to both the old and new tabs.
Example: If using React Router, update the routes:
jsx
Copy code
// src/App.js or src/routes.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import CurrentTab from './components/CurrentTab';
import NewTab from './components/NewTab';

function App() {
    return (
        <Router>
            <Switch>
                <Route path="/current" component={CurrentTab} />
                <Route path="/new" component={NewTab} />
            </Switch>
        </Router>
    );
}

export default App;
6. Documentation and Comments
Code Documentation: Ensure that all new code includes comments explaining its purpose and functionality.
Update Readme: Modify the README.md file to include information about the new component and tab. Explain any changes made to the project structure.
7. Testing
Test New Functionality: Validate that the new component and tab function as expected. Perform manual testing or write unit tests if applicable.
Example: If using Jest for testing, add tests for the new component and tab.
8. Final Review and Submission
Review Code: Ensure that the code is well-organized, with clear naming conventions and documentation.
Push Changes: Commit your changes and push them to the GitHub repository.
Submit: Follow the submission guidelines on GitHub Classroom to submit your assignment.
Grading Criteria Alignment
Functionality: Ensure that the new component and tab work correctly and integrate seamlessly with the existing application.
Documentation: Provide clear comments and update the README with relevant details about your changes.
Organization: Organize code into components and ensure it is divided logically into files and folders.
By following these steps, you'll ensure that your assignment meets the criteria and is submitted effectively.
